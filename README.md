### Project Description: ARP Spoofing (MITM) Attack Project using Python

#### Overview:
This project involves developing an **ARP Spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle Attack)** tool using Python. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing is a technique used to intercept and manipulate network traffic between two devices on a local network. By exploiting the ARP protocol's lack of authentication, an attacker can redirect traffic through their machine, allowing them to eavesdrop, modify, or inject data into the communication. This project is intended for educational purposes to understand how ARP spoofing works and to raise awareness about network security vulnerabilities.

---

#### Objectives:
- Create a Python-based tool to perform ARP spoofing (MITM attack).
- Implement functionality to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- Understand the ARP protocol and its vulnerabilities.
- Explore techniques for detecting and preventing ARP spoofing attacks.
- Learn about ethical hacking and network security.

---

#### Key Features:

1. **ARP Spoofing**:
   - Send forged ARP replies to poison the ARP cache of the target and gateway.
   - Redirect traffic between the target and gateway through the attacker's machine.

2. **Traffic Interception**:
   - Capture and analyze network traffic passing through the attacker's machine.
   - Support for HTTP, HTTPS, and other protocols (with limitations).

3. **Packet Manipulation**:
   - Modify or inject packets into the intercepted traffic (optional).
   - Demonstrate the risks of unencrypted communication.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Display intercepted traffic in real-time for analysis.
   - Log traffic to a file for further inspection.

5. **Restoration**:
   - Restore the ARP tables of the target and gateway after the attack.
   - Ensure the network returns to its normal state.

---

#### Tools and Technologies:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Scapy**: A powerful Python library for packet manipulation and network analysis.
- **Argparse**: For handling command-line arguments and options.
- **Threading**: For running multiple tasks concurrently (e.g., ARP spoofing and traffic monitoring).

---

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Setup**:
   - Install Python and the Scapy library (`pip install scapy`).
   - Ensure the script runs with elevated privileges (required for sending packets).

2. **ARP Spoofing**:
   - Use Scapy to send forged ARP replies to the target and gateway.
   - Poison the ARP cache of both devices to redirect traffic through the attacker's machine.

3. **Traffic Interception**:
   - Use Scapy to capture and analyze network traffic.
   - Filter traffic based on protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS).

4. **Packet Manipulation (Optional)**:
   - Modify or inject packets into the intercepted traffic.
   - Demonstrate the risks of unencrypted communication.

5. **Restoration**:
   - Send legitimate ARP replies to restore the ARP tables of the target and gateway.
   - Ensure the network returns to its normal state.

#### Example Workflow:

1. User runs the script with target and gateway IP addresses:
   ```
   python arp_spoofing.py --target 192.168.1.10 --gateway 192.168.1.1
   ```

2. The tool starts ARP spoofing:
   - Sends forged ARP replies to the target and gateway.
   - Redirects traffic between the target and gateway through the attacker's machine.

3. The tool captures and displays intercepted traffic:
   ```
   [HTTP Request] GET /login HTTP/1.1
   [HTTP Response] 200 OK
   ```

4. The tool restores the ARP tables after the attack:
   - Sends legitimate ARP replies to the target and gateway.
   - Ensures the network returns to its normal state.

---

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Gain hands-on experience with ARP spoofing and MITM attacks.
- Understand the ARP protocol and its vulnerabilities.
- Learn how to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- Develop awareness of network security risks and defensive measures.

---

#### Safety and Ethics:
- This project is strictly for educational purposes and ethical use only.
- Always obtain proper authorization before testing on any network.
- Do not use this tool for malicious or unauthorized activities.
- Use this knowledge to defend against ARP spoofing and protect network security.

This project is ideal for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and developers looking to explore network security and ethical hacking. It provides a practical way to understand how ARP spoofing works and how to defend against it.
